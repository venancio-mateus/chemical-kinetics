# Chemical Kinetics: From Potentiality to Act
This repository provides a suite of Python scripts (made as simple as possible) designed to bridge the gap between abstract kinetic theory and experimental reality. While the equations commonly presented in the large majority of seminal textbooks furnish a **potential** comprehensive of a system, the scrips here available allow the student to perform the **act** of processing raw data into meaningful scientific insights. 

**Contents:**
The tools provided here focus on three fundamental pillars of kinetic investigation:
- **Treatments of experimental data:** Tools to transform raw laboratory measurements into clean analyzable information.
- **Linear and non-linear fitting data:** More than simple lines or curves, the scripts provided here were constructed using robust statistical methods to find the order of chemical reactions and rate constants ($k$).
- **Simulations of the mechanism of chemical reactions:** Computational models to investigate how elementary reactions steps contribute to the macroscopic and global behavior of a process.
